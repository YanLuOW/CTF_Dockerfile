<h3>Site Import</h3>
    <p>
		This plugin allows you to import posts/items from other websites.
		You don't have to export anything, the content will be extracted directly from the site.
        It's really easy and intuitive. Watch the video "How it works" or click on the next tab above to start!

<h3>Limitations</h3>
	<p>
		Remember that our plugin doesn't work with every website.
		Some of them have different structure of the posts and it is too hard to recognize the parts of the site automatically.
		But of course we are still trying to improve it, so that the most of the websites will work properly.
