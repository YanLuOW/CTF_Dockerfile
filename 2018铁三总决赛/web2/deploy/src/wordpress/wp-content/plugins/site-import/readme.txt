-	detect taxonomies depending on what type of the post you selected
-	set how many posts you want to add
-	see final preview of the data

= Limitations =
Remember that our plugin doesn't work with every website. Some of them have different structure of the posts and it is too hard to recognize the parts of the site automatically. But of course we are still trying to improve it, so that the most of the websites will work properly.
